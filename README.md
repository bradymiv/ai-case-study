# Case Study: OpenAI and the Field of Natural Language Processing (NLP)

## Overview and Origin

- **Name of Company:** OpenAI  
- **Incorporporation Date:** December 11, 2015  
- **Founders:** Elon Musk, Sam Altman, Greg Brockman, Ilya Sutskever, Wojciech Zaremba, and John Schulman  
- **Mission:** To ensure artificial general intelligence (AGI) benefits all of humanity.  

OpenAI’s founding idea emerged from the recognition that AI technology, if developed improperly, could pose significant risks. The company’s mission reflects a commitment to aligning AGI with human values. OpenAI transitioned from a non-profit to a "capped-profit" model.

**Funding:** OpenAI has raised significant funding, including over $11 billion from backers such as Microsoft. The company operates in close collaboration with Microsoft through the Azure cloud infrastructure, enabling scalable AI development and deployment.
